This is from project of [jfzhang95](https://github.com/jfzhang95/pytorch-deeplab-xception)

some changes for video object segmentation
- [ ] dataloader for davis and youtube-VOS
- [ ] Building deeplab v3+ with pixel mask as the fourth input channel
- [ ] Add pretrained model and change lr, weight for a better result


### Introduction
This is a Pytorch implementation of [DeepLab-Xception](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.02611), It's based on a Modified Aligned Xception backbone. Currently, we train DeepLab V3+ from scratch, using Pascal Voc 2012 dataset.

### TODO
- [x] Basic deeplab v3+ model
- [x] Training deeplab v3+ on SBD dataset
- [ ] Add pretrained model and results evaluation


### Requirements
```
Python3.x (Tested with 3.5)
PyTorch (Tested with 0.4.0)
tensorboardX
opencv-python
```
